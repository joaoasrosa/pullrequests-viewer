# Development
This is the development guide. It gives guidance (is the idea of a guide, right?!) for development on this repo. It is a work in progress, I'm waiting for your feedback (you can contribute in any shape or form, to start use the [contributing guide][contributing_guide])

## Tests


## Styling guide
We (try our best) to follow the [.NET coding style][dotnet_coding_style]. It's on my plans to integrate it into the build pipeline, to produce a report. Everyone will be happy.
