# Setup your environment
The tool is developed using .NET Core. There are a wide range of IDE's for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux.

## Installing the SDK
We are cutting edge, so cutting edge that we use .NET Core 2.1 (Preview version). Download and install the SDK from [here][dotnet-sdk] (select for your OS).

## IDE
Well, this is the tricky part. It was developed using [Visual Studio 2017 Preview][vs2017_preview] and [Jetbrains Rider][jetbrains_rider]. You can use [Visual Studio Code][vscode] or (suggest other IDE). Make sure that you have all the dependencies for .NET Core development.

## Advanced
If you want to aid with advanced features, such as container development, you need to install [Docker][docker]. If you are at this point, you know what it is. :)
