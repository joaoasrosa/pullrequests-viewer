# Contributing
This project needs you! If you found an issue, or you want to actively contribute, this is the starting point!

But wait, are you asking... Where should I start?

## The place where it starts
If you get to this point, you have my respect! You are using the tool, and that is awesome! Thanks!!

As a starting point you need to create an issue. GitHub is awesome, and for a small project like this, the issue tracker is what we need (KISS, right?).
Click on *Issues* tab on top, and open a issue (or use this [link][issues]). The discussion will start, and it will be tagged accordely.

## This tool is technical, I'm a techie, and I will enhance it!
If you get this far, you heavly use the tool and that *bug* (sometimes we call it *by design*) really annoys you. Well, it's OSS, and you want to left your mark, enhancing it.

Start forking the repo (assuming that you have an [GitHub account]). This [guide][forking_guide] will help you with the task.
Then fork the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/pullrequests-viewer.git

Setup your machine folowing this guide TODO!
